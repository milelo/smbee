## Button cells

Button cells can be deadly particularly to young children. This is a typical warning from a button cell data sheet:
>Serious harm in as little as 2-hours if swallowed.<BR>
>KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN.<BR>
>Seek immediate medical help if swallowed.

See also BBC health: [Button batteries pose 'deadly' risk to toddlers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37410343){:target="bbc"}.

This project uses a button cell. The cell holder is designed to securely retain the cell and requires a tool to remove it. The very low sleep drain allows the cell to be left connected for long durations so the cell only needs to be removed to be replaced. 

## Soldering irons and Hot air

These tools produce high temperatures which can easily cause skin burns if not handles correctly, they also generate temperatures above the combustion temperature of paper so treat them as you would a naked flame.

Additional guidelines are provided in the [environment](./smbee/environment.md) section.

## Solder and flux fumes

Please read the guidelines provided in the [environment](./smbee/environment.md) section.
