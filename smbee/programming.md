The bee will need to be programmed before it will function. To do this you will need access to:
* SMBeeHive programmer and dock, borrow one or [make your own](../make-a-beehive).
* A computer with a USB port and compatible with the [AVRDUDE](https://www.nongnu.org/avrdude/){:target="avrdude"} programming utility like a laptop or a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/){:target="rpi"}.

The full programming instruction are available in the [SMBeeFirmware](https://github.com/milelo/SMBeeFirmware){:target="SMBeeFirmware"} repository.
