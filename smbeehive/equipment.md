Item | Image | Description
-|-|-
Tap | ![M3 tap](assets/M3-tap.jpg){:width="200px"} | An M3 Coarse (0.5mm pitch) taper-tap used to cut the threads into some of the acrylic case holes to take the nylon screws.
Tap-wrench | ![tap wrench](assets/tap-wrench.jpg){:width="600px"}  | An M3 compatible tap-wrench. This wrench has a ratchet but it doesn't add much benefit over the simpler types.
Pliers | ![](assets/small-pliers.jpg){:width="600px"} | Small pliers to remove the pins from the header pin body.
Calipers | ![](assets/digital-calipers.jpg){:width="800px"} | Digital or vernier calipers to accurately measure the acrylic thickness for laser cutting. I intend to design a gauge that can be laser cut from scrap material so these won't be necessary.
